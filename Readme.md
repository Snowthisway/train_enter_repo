This adds a new vehicle (metrotrain2) with the exact same model as the default metrotrain. Its added to trains.xml in order to be spawnable by CreateMissionTrain.

use /train_enter_test to be teleported to a trainstation and have both the default metro and this new addon metro spawned for comparison.
